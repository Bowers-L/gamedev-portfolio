<div class="paragraph">
 <strong>Slider</strong> is a game led by 
 <a href="https://randomerz.com" target="_blank">Daniel Carr</a> 
 and getting released 
 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1916890/Slider/" target="_blank">On Steam</a> (eventually).<br><br>

 Slider is by far the most high profile game project I've worked on (as of Spring 2023), 
 having been demoed at multiple local and GT events, including <b>Dreamhack Atlanta 2022</b>, and being recently selected as an <b>IGF finalist</b> for best student game <b>@ GDC 2023</b>.<br><br>

That being said, the game is also the largest and most complex game I've worked on, and it has been quite the journey developing key gameplay systems that are used in several of the game's areas.
With both an Ocean and a Mountain of content (literally), I have probably gained more experience working on this project than the rest of my projects combined, especially with working within such a large team for a student project.<br><br>

<div class="paragraph">
    I was responsible for the development of multiple gameplay systems and tools, including (but not limited to):
    <ul>
        <li>A Move Queue System with Interrupts</li>
        <li>Custom Dynamic Lighting with Shaders/Light Maps.</li>
        <li>Custom Pathfinding for NPCs in a 2D Tilemap</li>
        <li>AI Behaviour Trees and Steering (The Infamous Rat)</li>
        <li>An NPC Event-Based Dialogue System with designer customization</li>
        <li>An Electricity/Power gameplay system with a dynamic graph structure</li>
        <li>Countless bug fixes, optimizations, and refactors over the span of a year for a growing codebase</li>
    </ul>

    Each one of these bullets really deserves its own page, and I would love to go into a deeper
    dive on some of these systems in the future. For now, enjoy the results of this work below:

It has been a remarkable journey to work with such a talented team of developers. I am incredibly grateful to have worked with such a team. Special thanks to Daniel (aka Boomo) for even making this project possible.
